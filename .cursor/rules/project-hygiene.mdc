# Project Hygiene & Structure

## File Management
- **No Documentation Bloat:** Do not create `.md`, `README` updates, or architectural diagrams unless explicitly requested.
- **Clean Deletions:** When refactoring, suggest deleting unused files immediately.
- **Grouping:** Maintain a logical folder hierarchy consistent with standard Xcode project structures.

## AI Interaction Guidelines
- **Be Concise:** Provide code first, explanation second.
- **Incremental Changes:** Propose small, testable changes rather than rewriting entire files.
- **Linter Awareness:** Follow standard SwiftLint rules (short lines, no trailing whitespace) even if a linter isn't installed.

## Forbidden Patterns
- No over-abstraction of simple UI components.
- No boilerplate-heavy patterns like Coordinator if the native `NavigationStack` handles the requirement.
